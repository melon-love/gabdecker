        "body": "I know nothing about Kratom, but there is evidence that cannabis oil (aka Rick Simpson Oil or RSO) cures many cancers, and has many other medicinal uses. No, it isn't FDA approved, and probably never will be. Nobody is going to spend those millions of dollars getting approval for a common weed.\n\nCBD oil, made from non-psychoactive hemp, is useful for lots of things. But some conditions respond only to the psychoactive variety. Cannabis Indica, which gives a body high, and tends to put you to sleep, apparently works better than Cannabis Sativa, which gives a head high.\n\nI'm not a stoner. Been there. Done that. 35 years ago. God works better than drugs. But if I get cancer, RSO will be the first thing I try.\n\nhttp://phoenixtears.ca",

I could point out at least 50 people who’ve given up on Gab because within hours of their start there’s been a barrage of tranny porn, child porn, plain porn with no NSFW tag, and/or obviously mentally ill people hating on them.  It has been a REAL problem.  One of the groups of ladies here left Gab all together because of several persistent tranny posters. We told them about tools for muting, and they came back to Gab.\n\nWe don’t tell people WHO to mute. That’s up to each person.  It’s Free Speech here, but that doesn’t mean we’re a captive audience. In real life you can walk away from a speech, stop reading a book, etc. Here you can mute.\n\nSo don’t blame the welcome committee  for teaching about muting. Blame the assholes who think their free speech gives them the right to gang up on newbies to spew hatred and porn in an effort to make them leave Gab.",

Mute, mute, mute. Let them spew into silence. (See drop down menu—3 dots in top RH corner of post for Mute User.)\n\nYou might also want to try Introducing Yourself here in this group. \nIntroduce Yourself https://gab.ai/groups/398c3c05-c722-484a-9264-b94f165d6656\n\nIf you have any questions then just ask any or all of the volunteer welcome committee: @TienLeung , @JPerkinsJune @BOBOFkake @R_Olney,  @SteveSmith @ Millwood16 @MagicGenie , @ ROCKintheUSSA, \n@ Joeljustwokeup, @knitwit,@ militanthippy, @deplorableBuilder, @LibertyLion @BetterNot2Know, @PorkyPig205, @SkepticalPr0thean  \n❤️🐸 \n\nIf you want to follow Pres. Trump, @RealTrumpTweets is a Gab volunteer who mirrors all of Trump’s tweets. Also you may want to follow @realdonaldtrump Gab account that Gab has reserved for the President. \n         \nTop 6 Ways To Participate, Add Value and Gain Followers (aka increase your audience): \n\n1. Follow others, MANY others. Check their profile page first!! Most will follow back.  \n2. Start regularly posting ORIGINAL material/content. This can not be stressed enough! \n3.Posting from your home page, especially with few followers means hardly anyone will see your posts. For more visibility, start your posts from a topic, category or group. Reposting is fine BUT...DO NOT ONLY RE-POST. Make sure you have other content too. \n4.Join a group. Participate in the groups discussions. \n5. Reply to other GABers posts. If you want to ADD some commentary to their post, you use the \"Quote\" button. \n6. Make sure you have some kind of profile image/photo. Many won't follow if you do not.\n",

          "body": "The reason the volunteer Welcome Committee members give information on muting to newbies is because we have all seen the harassment and targeting of newbies here.  I could point out at least 50 people who’ve given up on Gab because within hours of their start there’s been a barrage of tranny porn, child porn, plain porn with no NSFW tag, and/or obviously mentally ill people hating on them.  It has been a REAL problem.  One of the groups of ladies here left Gab all together because of several persistent tranny posters. We told them about tools for muting, and they came back to Gab.\n\nWe don’t tell people WHO to mute. That’s up to each person.  It’s Free Speech here, but that doesn’t mean we’re a captive audience. In real life you can walk away from a speech, stop reading a book, etc. Here you can mute.\n\nSo don’t blame the welcome committee  for teaching about muting. Blame the assholes who think their free speech gives them the right to gang up on newbies to spew hatred and porn in an effort to make them leave Gab.",

            "body": "Welcome to Gab, Ronald!\nI’m a volunteer member of the Welcome Committee here so I hope you don’t mind a long post.\nFor the basics of Gab see https://help.gab.com\n\nIt’s free speech here and if you’re new you’ve probably seen some ugly stuff.  That’s what Mute is for! When you see obviously hateful accounts, please mute them.  These are trolls in hiding trying to hurt Gab and keep new users from joining. Don’t fall for this trap. Mute, mute, mute. Let them spew into silence. (See drop down menu—3 dots in top RH corner of post for Mute User.)\n\nYou might also want to try Introducing Yourself here in this group. \nIntroduce Yourself https://gab.ai/groups/398c3c05-c722-484a-9264-b94f165d6656\n\nIf you have any questions then just ask any or all of the volunteer welcome committee: @TienLeung , @JPerkinsJune @BOBOFkake @R_Olney,  @SteveSmith @ Millwood16 @MagicGenie , @ ROCKintheUSSA, \n@ Joeljustwokeup, @knitwit,@ militanthippy, @deplorableBuilder, @LibertyLion @BetterNot2Know, @PorkyPig205, @SkepticalPr0thean  \n❤️🐸 \n\nIf you want to follow Pres. Trump, @RealTrumpTweets is a Gab volunteer who mirrors all of Trump’s tweets. Also you may want to follow @realdonaldtrump Gab account that Gab has reserved for the President. \n         \nTop 6 Ways To Participate, Add Value and Gain Followers (aka increase your audience): \n\n1. Follow others, MANY others. Check their profile page first!! Most will follow back.  \n2. Start regularly posting ORIGINAL material/content. This can not be stressed enough! \n3.Posting from your home page, especially with few followers means hardly anyone will see your posts. For more visibility, start your posts from a topic, category or group. Reposting is fine BUT...DO NOT ONLY RE-POST. Make sure you have other content too. \n4.Join a group. Participate in the groups discussions. \n5. Reply to other GABers posts. If you want to ADD some commentary to their post, you use the \"Quote\" button. \n6. Make sure you have some kind of profile image/photo. Many won't follow if you do not.\n",

            "body": "Welcome to Gab, Ronald!\nI’m a volunteer member of the Welcome Committee here so I hope you don’t mind a long post.\nFor the basics of Gab see https://help.gab.com\n\nIt’s free speech here and if you’re new you’ve probably seen some ugly stuff.  That’s what Mute is for! When you see obviously hateful accounts, please mute them.  These are trolls in hiding trying to hurt Gab and keep new users from joining. Don’t fall for this trap. Mute, mute, mute. Let them spew into silence. (See drop down menu—3 dots in top RH corner of post for Mute User.)\n\nYou might also want to try Introducing Yourself here in this group. \nIntroduce Yourself https://gab.ai/groups/398c3c05-c722-484a-9264-b94f165d6656\n\nIf you have any questions then just ask any or all of the volunteer welcome committee: @TienLeung , @JPerkinsJune @BOBOFkake @R_Olney,  @SteveSmith @ Millwood16 @MagicGenie , @ ROCKintheUSSA, \n@ Joeljustwokeup, @knitwit,@ militanthippy, @deplorableBuilder, @LibertyLion @BetterNot2Know, @PorkyPig205, @SkepticalPr0thean  \n❤️🐸 \n\nIf you want to follow Pres. Trump, @RealTrumpTweets is a Gab volunteer who mirrors all of Trump’s tweets. Also you may want to follow @realdonaldtrump Gab account that Gab has reserved for the President. \n         \nTop 6 Ways To Participate, Add Value and Gain Followers (aka increase your audience): \n\n1. Follow others, MANY others. Check their profile page first!! Most will follow back.  \n2. Start regularly posting ORIGINAL material/content. This can not be stressed enough! \n3.Posting from your home page, especially with few followers means hardly anyone will see your posts. For more visibility, start your posts from a topic, category or group. Reposting is fine BUT...DO NOT ONLY RE-POST. Make sure you have other content too. \n4.Join a group. Participate in the groups discussions. \n5. Reply to other GABers posts. If you want to ADD some commentary to their post, you use the \"Quote\" button. \n6. Make sure you have some kind of profile image/photo. Many won't follow if you do not.\n",

If you want to point out evil things that some people do, and mention as an aside that they happen to be Jewish, that's cool. As long as you mention as an aside that other criminals are Christian, or Muslim, or Hindu, or Atheist.\n\nJew haters think the Jewish part is predominant. The rest of us can see that Jews are certainly congregated in certain professions, e.g. banking and media, but we don't attempt to reverse the implication arrow to make any invalid conclusions about all Jews. Nor do we really care about genetics or religion when it comes to crime. A crime is an act, not an actor.",

He did so, so that Obama could set up the false narrative of gun crime being out of control because of the free availability of firearms in the U.S. A narrative they hoped to use in the further erosion of our #2A rights. Rights that Holder and Obama swore an oath to defend and uphold. Multiple people have died, and probably will continue to die, at the hands of the criminals he ran the weapons to. The most notable is Border Patrol Man Brian Terry killed December 14, 2010 while trying to apprehend a cartel crew that was running the border. His death was what broke the story to the public.

I click on the links to go to Gab.com, if I want to interact.\n\r\nI'm working on the ability to add and remove feed columns, and to persist them in your browser's `LocalStorage`.\n\r\nAfter that, I'll add the interactive functions, post/reply/quote/like/upvote/downvote/repost\n\r\nThen the notifications feed.\n\r\nA reminder to @developers that a POST to https://api.gab.com/v1.0/posts still gets a 429 error, \"Too Many Requests\".\n\r\nTODO list: https://github.com/melon-love/gabdecker/blob/master/TODO.md \n\r\nI've also decided how I'll make money. I'll show one simple ad, with link, in each column, until you pay me $1/month for a subscription.\n\r\nI need to find an ad provider other than Google, since that will cause lots of potential users to avoid GabDecker. And I need to find a payment processor. Suggestions?\n\r\nOf course, the simplest payment processor is check / money order / cash in the mail, but that requires revealing my address to the world, or getting a PO box in a nearby town. I'll have to think on whether I want to do that. Not that it's hard to find.\n\r\nI could support crypto, but after being burned by MT.GOX, whose bankruptcy is still in process, I'm hesitant to rely on converting crypto to FRNs. If I could buy food and rent with crypto, it would be a different matter, but so far I can't.\r\n\r\nI plan to store on my server only Gab username and expiration date, and nothing else.

I'll have to think on whether I want to do that. Not that it's hard to find.</p>\n<p>I could support crypto, but after being burned by MT.GOX, whose bankruptcy is still in process, I'm hesitant to rely on converting crypto to FRNs.
